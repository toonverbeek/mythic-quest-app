# (Mythic) Quest App

A simple react-native app, bootstrapped with Expo. Tested on Web and iOS.

Built using - _cheff's kiss_ - TypeScript.

## Local development

1. To run, make sure you have the `expo-cli` installed globally. 
2. Install dependencies using `yarn` 
3. Start the development server with `yarn start`

## Tech stack

1. State management with hooks
2. Data fetching with [swr](https://swr.vercel.app)
3. Mock storage with [Async Storage](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/)
3. Date utils by [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/docs/Getting-Started)

## Things to add

2 main things I would have loved to add but, for the sake of time, ommitted: testing and better styling with something like [tailwind-rn](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/tailwind-rn).
